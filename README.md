# Red Lens Reader

This project emulates the old Hintbooks and Copy Protections where you had to use a red lens to read the text.

You can get all the examples directly from github. Also every Book has a base64 version you can download right here. (right click -> save as...)
You can even try it out here (link)

## Hintbooks
- Code-Name: Iceman [base64]()
- Gold Rush! [base64]()
- Maniac Mansion [base64]()

## Copy Protection
- Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade [base64]()
- Loom [base64]()

### Limitations
- The Adventure window shows the hidden page under all the transparencies. This means you can not have irregular shaped windows at the moment.
- The clipped window can only be a rectangle. This makes things like the Laura Bow 1 copy protection not possible at the moment.

### Miscellaneous Notes
- The Sierra Adventure Windows have a very small red window. I opted for a bigger one for convenience in the Reader.

- The Lucasfilm Games Window has a stem at the bottom. Due to the limitations it can not be represented accurately.

- The Lucasfilm Games Hintbooks had a piece of red gel and not the Window I use in the Reader. The copy protection in Loom and Indy 3 uses it and I think it looks better in the hintbook too.
