# Red Lens Reader

This project emulates the old Hintbooks and Copy Protections where you had to use a red lens to read the text.

You can get all the examples directly from github. Also every Book has a base64 version you can download right here. (right click -> save as...)  
You can simply try it ([here](https://red-lens-reader.vercel.app/))

## Hintbooks
- Code-Name: Iceman [base64](https://github.com/Eulisker/RedLensReader/raw/refs/heads/main/base64/Code-Name%20-%20Iceman%20(1989)%20Hintbook%20Reader.html)
- Gold Rush! [base64](https://github.com/Eulisker/RedLensReader/raw/refs/heads/main/base64/Gold%20Rush!%20(1988)%20Hintbook%20Reader.html)
- Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade
- Loom
- Maniac Mansion [base64](https://github.com/Eulisker/RedLensReader/raw/refs/heads/main/base64/Maniac%20Mansion%20(1987)%20Hintbook%20Reader.html)
- Monkey Island 2 - LeChuck's Revenge
- Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders

## Copy Protection
- Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade [base64](https://github.com/Eulisker/RedLensReader/raw/refs/heads/main/base64/Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade%20(1989)%20Copy%20Protection%20Reader.html)
- Loom [base64](https://github.com/Eulisker/RedLensReader/raw/refs/heads/main/base64/Loom%20(1990)%20Copy%20Protection%20Reader.html)

### Limitations
- The Adventure window shows the hidden page under all the transparencies. This means you can not have irregular shaped windows at the moment.
- The clipped window can only be a rectangle. This makes things like the Laura Bow 1 copy protection not possible at the moment.

### Miscellaneous Notes
- The Sierra Adventure Windows have a very small red window. I opted for a bigger one for convenience in the Reader.

- The Lucasfilm Games Window has a stem at the bottom. Due to the limitations it can not be represented accurately.

- The Lucasfilm Games Hintbooks had a piece of red gel and not the Window I use in the Reader. The copy protection in Loom and Indy 3 uses it and I think it looks better in the hintbook too.
